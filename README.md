# Major Project in Program Design and Development
## Project Description 
This project built an interactive Paint program for digital artists. In the project we created several different types of brushes and used these to paint onto a digital canvas. Later in the semester, we extend this tool to include some of the
features that are common in photo editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop.
